# PDF ChatGPT Chatbot

This project is a conversational chatbot that allows users to upload a PDF file and interact with its contents using natural language queries. The chatbot utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo for generating responses and FAISS for indexing and searching the PDF content.

## Features

- Upload PDF files and extract their contents.
- Index the PDF content using FAISS.
- Query the indexed content and get relevant responses generated by GPT-3.5-turbo.
- Simple and easy-to-use API built with FastAPI.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- An OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-chatgpt-chatbot.git
    cd pdf-chatgpt-chatbot
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'  # On Windows, use `set OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'`
    ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the FastAPI server:

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

2. The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## API Endpoints

### Upload PDF

- **Endpoint**: `/upload_pdf`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Uploads a PDF file and indexes its content.
- **Request**:
    - `file`: The PDF file to upload.
- **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "PDF content indexed successfully."
    }
    ```

### Query PDF

- **Endpoint**: `/query_pdf`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Queries the indexed PDF content and gets a response generated by GPT-3.5-turbo.
- **Request**:
    - `query`: The query to search for.
- **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "response": "Generated response based on the PDF content."
    }
    ```

## Testing

1. To run the tests, ensure you have `pytest` installed:

    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2. Run the tests:

    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the FastAPI application and endpoints.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for extracting text from PDF, indexing content, and generating responses.
- `test_main.py`: Contains test cases for the application.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

## Notes

- Ensure your OpenAI API key is kept secure and not hard-coded in the source code.
- The FAISS index is kept in-memory for simplicity. For larger datasets or production use, consider persisting the index to disk.
